## Why I Created This Blog

While working at my current job, I would experience difficulties when working with some poorly
documented issues online. Some of these issues would come up, time and time again. This cycle
would drive me insane. A lot of these issues weren't anything that a PhD professor would need
to write his/her thesis on, and I figured I thought this would be a great way to contribute to
a community that I rely so heavily on when doing my work. The community that wraps itself around

## Where I Went to School

I graduated from UCI in 2015 with a degree in Computer Science. Previously I attended Fullerton College
which is where I met a handful of friends and professor that got me to find a love/passion for coding.
I feel like if I didn't originally attend my junior college and meet the people that I did, I probably
would've ended up as a history major or something.

## What I Do For Fun

Sometimes...

Mostly...

``` csharp
class Program
{
	static void Main(string[] args)
	{
		int i;
		Console.Write("Enter a Number : ");
		i = int.Parse(Console.ReadLine());
		if (i % 2 == 0)
		{
			Console.Write("Entered Number is an Even Number");
			Console.Read();
		}
		else
		{
			Console.Write("Entered Number is an Odd Number");
			Console.Read();
		}
	}
}
```
